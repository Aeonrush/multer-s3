# Multer S3

Streaming multer storage engine for AWS S3.

This project is mostly an integration piece for existing code samples from Multer's [storage engine documentation](https://github.com/expressjs/multer/blob/master/StorageEngine.md) with [s3fs](https://github.com/RiptideElements/s3fs) as the substitution piece for file system.  Existing solutions I found required buffering the multipart uploads into the actual filesystem which is difficult to scale.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save multer-s3
```

## Usage

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var multer = require('multer')
var s3 = require('multer-s3')

var app = express()

var upload = multer({
  storage: s3({
    bucket: 'some-bucket',
    secretAccessKey: 'some secret',
    accessKeyId: 'some key',
    region: 'us-east-1',
    key: function (req, file, cb) {
      cb(null, Date.now().toString())
    }
  })
})

app.post('/upload', upload.array('photos', 3), function(req, res, next) {
  res.send('Successfully uploaded ' + req.files.length + ' files!')
})
```

## Testing

Tested with [s3rver](https://github.com/jamhall/s3rver) instead of your actual s3 credentials.  Doesn't require a real account or changing of hosts files.  Includes integration tests ensuring that it should work with express + multer.

```sh
npm test
```
